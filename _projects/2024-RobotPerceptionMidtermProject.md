Tracking and state estimation are essential in autonomous navigation, where sensor-based measurements are used to predict and update vehicle positions. We chose to explore aspects of the pan-tilt camera looking from above modeled using the pinhole camera model. We also craft a simulation to track a car from above with a camera.
