## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/outside_headshot.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}
 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I was born and raised in Maryland, where I fostered my love for mechanical engineering ever since I was young. I started out watching my grandfather take apart clocks and playing with Legos. Starting in fourth grade, I dived into building robots through FIRST Lego League, FIRST Tech Challenge, and eventually FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), where I solidified my love for mechanical engineering. Through my journey, I have developed strong mechanical intuition, design thinking, and personal approaches to problem solving. 

Entering college, I broadened my understanding of mechanical engineering by immersing myself in the Cornell Racing Formula SAE project team, where we designed and built an electric racecar. Working on such a large, complex system taught me the importance of collaboration, as every moving part relied on the team's synergy. Ensuring my components integrated seamlessly with interfacing parts deepened my appreciation for engineering's interdisciplinary nature. The fast-paced environment and ambitious timeline demanded focus and dedication, inspiring us to push toward a common goal with unwavering commitment.

After two years of my undergraduate study, I realized that in addition to mechanical engineering, I was still passionate about robotics. I started refocused my coursework, taking classes such as Foundations of Robotics, Model-Based Estimation, Machine Learning, Robot Perception, and Theory of Linear Systems. I also joined a research lab, applying skills in ROS and estimation techniques to localization and tracking of a wheeled unmanned ground vehicle. These experiences reaffirmed my passion for robotics and inspired me to advance my knowledge further.

Some hobbies I have are playing frisbee, rock climbing, nature photography and playing piano.
